/*! 
 * README FIRST
 * ------------------------------------------------------------ 
 * Important details about representation of memory blocks, the data structures
 * used in implementing this allocator, and the meaning of various commonly
 * used variables 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------ 
 * Memory block representation:
 *      Free blocks: The metadata for free blocks includes a node struct
 *      (see myalloc.h), which is the "header", as well as a simple int
 *      which is the "footer". The "header" node struct has 3 fields,
 *      which are:
 *          a) space: a positive integer that is the amount of usable bytes
 *              in the block (the payload size), and is also the distance from
 *              the int tag in the header to the footer. *NOTE* -- this
 *              is not the distance from the end of the header struct to
 *              the footer, it is actually the distance from the int tag
 *              in the header (offset of 4 bytes from header start) to footer.
 *          b) prev: This is a pointer to another header struct (a node *).
 *              The allocator has an explicit free list, implemented as a 
 *              doubly linked list. This field links each free block to the
 *              previous free block. Note that the first block in the free list
 *              would have NULL for this field
 *          c) next: Again, pointer to another header to implement the free
 *              list. Note that the last block in the free list would have NULL.
 *      The "footer", which is just an int, has the same value as the space 
 *      field of the header struct. Thus, there is an int tag on both ends
 *      of free blocks giving the amount of bytes between the two int tags.
 * 
 *      Allocated blocks: The metadata for allocated blocks is more limited
 *      -- there is just an int tag on both end, no header struct. This tag
 *      is very similar to the tags in free blocks, except it is negative
 *      , to denote the memory is in use. Thus, it is the negation of the space
 *      field in the header for the freed version of the same block.      
 *  
 * Commonly used variables:
 *      freeList -- a global node * (static memory) that points to the header
 *          for the first free block in the explicit free list.
 *      dataptr -- an unsigned char * that is always used to be the exact 
 *          address of the start of a block
 *      headptr -- a node * that has the same value as dataptr, 
 *          (meaning it points to the start of a block), but can be used to
 *          do linked list operations/look at fields of the header for a free
 *          block.
 *      footptr -- an int * that points to the footer of a block (the int tag)
 *      space -- an int that is always the size of the payload of a block.
 *          In other words, it is the value saved in headptr->space, as well
 *          as footptr, for a free block, and it is the negation of the value
 *          in (int *) dataptr, as well as footptr, for an allocated block. 
 *          Thus, to find a footer address from a dataptr, one can say
 *          dataptr + sizeof(int) + space, and to find the next block's address
 *          (a new dataptr), one can say dataptr + space + 2 * sizeof(int)
 *
 * Implementation features:
 *      -- explicit free list
 *      -- constant time deallocation
 *      -- best fit instead of next-fit or first-fit
 *      -- realloc function, fun stuff XD, made it on a whim.
 *
 * Things minimizing fragmentation:
 *      -- best fit ensures that smallest block that can accomodate a request
 *         is used
 *      -- both forward and reverse coalescing means contiguous freed blocks
 *         are combined
 *

 * trivial pointer arithmetic, and the addNode function is constant time since 
 * the node is added to the beginning of free list, so no iteration through
 * the free list is required. The coalesce backward logic involves
 * just using the footer of the previous block to find the block head, so
 * no iteration through blocks is required, while the coalesce forward
 * logic is also pointer arithmetic. The lack of iteration through the
 * list means that both versions of coalescing are constant time, since
 * the coalesce function itself is constant time (also just pointer arithmetic).
 * Hence, myfree has a fixed number of stages, all that occur in constant time, 
 * and so, is O(1) with respect to number of blocks in the memory pool overall.
